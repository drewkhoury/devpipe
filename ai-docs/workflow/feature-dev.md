Purpose:
Controlled feature development without scope creep or test gaps.

When to use:
Any time you add new behavior.

Core flow:
- Plan files, risks, and test strategy.
- Implement only what was planned.
- Follow BDD/TDD flow (add feature tests, see fail, add step files, add unit tests, then code until green)
- Run validation.
- Audit for security and performance.
