## 🎨 Design Concept

The Flowmunk embodies the spirit of DevPipe: fast, efficient, and always watching your builds with keen attention.

### Silhouette
- **Triangular head** tapering forward like a speedy dart
- **Compact diamond-shaped body** for streamlined efficiency
- **Short angular limbs** suggesting quick movement
- **Tail shaped like a smooth pipeline curve** - abstract enough to be elegant, not literal

### Face
- **Large round eyes** perfect for the cursor-following animation
- **Minimal mouth** with tiny cheek dash lines for that chipmunk spirit
- **Alert expression** that says "I'm watching your pipeline run!"

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Orange or warm amber with muted gradients
- **Accents**: Dark teal or cyan markings along the tail curve to imply flow
- **Eyes**: White pupils that follow your cursor

### Pipeline Metaphor (Subtle)
A single thin stripe along the tail that breaks into small nodes near the tip - representing the flow of tasks through your pipeline.

### Accessory
Tiny geometric wrench clipped to the side of the body like a badge (not held) - because every good pipeline needs the right tools.
